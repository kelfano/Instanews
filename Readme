This is a single page news thread linked to a New York times server using the open API source. It used an ajax method to first send a request to the server then retrieve the information of the top stories and render those on the webpage.There are 6 different categories with 12 inclusive stories chosen for the user.

## What I learned
In this project, I learnt how to using jquery method to set up a request from a browser to a server in order to retrieve information for the browser. Method included filtering and slicing the array elements into 12 elements only. I also learnt how to use Sass Features to declare the child elements inside the parents declaration function in order to make the code looks more tidy and runs more efficient.
